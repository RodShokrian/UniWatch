UniWatch is an application, inspired by Open University Data, built using Rails on the backend and a React/Redux frontend. This app will, at a minimum, include these features:

1. An index of major universities in the United States displaying key data on each (e.g., location, private/public institution, admissions %)
2. A user's profile page displaying university of attendance or alumnus status and universities that the user has followed
3. A feature to follow universities, displaying them in the user's profile page
4. A search feature, allowing users to, at a minimum, find specific universities by name.

Bonus Features:

1. An RSS feed of news relevant to universities the user has followed, to be displayed on the user's profile page
2. A Google Maps API call, to display the location of a university on its show page.
3. Data visualization, including charts and graphs to show or compare key metrics between universities.
4. Widgets to filter universities on the index page, e.g., by state, public/private institution, HBCU status, etc.
5. A more robust search feature, allowing users to search and filter universities by metrics, including grad school test scores, admissions percentages, etc.
